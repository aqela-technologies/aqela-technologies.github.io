            <SubTitleText align="left">In 2022, a group of diverse individuals with a shared passion for societal
                change and
                technological innovation came together to establish Aqela Technologies, LLP. As a Romanian tech
                development company, we&apos;re driven by the ambition to become a leading local tech hub and
                community
                builder. We&apos;ve always been intrigued by highly innovative and, at times, controversial
                technologies
                like blockchain. Our journey took a significant turn when we won an EU tender at our launch,
                confirming the wider interest in our resourceful ideas.</SubTitleText>

                for weighted voting. We aim to increase participation in public decision-making within the EU and
                enhance the societal benefits of democratic decisions. We&apos;ve outlined several key milestones to
